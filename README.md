# Punk API
created by Khemi Ramyead

This project uses the punk_api (https://punkapi.com) to allow the user to search for beers. This page uses React to provide the user with beers' name, tagline, abv, first brewed date and ph levels. The user can also filter the beers using the abv>6, classic range and ph<4 checkboxes.

## Design

The page has been deisgned with the mobile-first approach. The mobile-version does not accomodate the checkbox filters.

## Improvements

This page can be improved further by adding a drop-down selection menu for the checkbox filters on the mobile version to be space-effient. Further improvements would include adding a feature where more information about the beer is provided to the user when they click on a beer card.
